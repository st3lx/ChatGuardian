# ChatGuardian
A desktop app to proactively archive and retroactively recover WeChat, Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, [basically any app you want to add] messages &amp; media from local device backups.

**It WILL Work / Is Designed For**
✅ Recovering data from existing backups (iTunes, adb, Google Drive backups of the device).	
✅ Recovering "deleted" data that still exists in a backup file (e.g., you deleted chats after your last backup).	
✅ Recovering "out-of-date" data like old images whose links have expired, from a backup.	
✅ Proactive archiving via scheduled, automated local backups and parsing.	
✅ Organizing and preserving data you already have access to (via backup).	
✅ Acting as a powerful viewer for your own archived chat history across devices.	
**It WILL NOT Work / Is Not Designed For**
❌ Recovering data from a factory-reset or broken phone with no pre-existing backup.
❌ Recovering data that has been physically overwritten on the device's storage (true forensic data recovery).
❌ Bypassing app encryption or hacking into accounts without the backup file or password.
❌ Real-time message interception or violating the terms of service of the chat apps.
❌ 100% reliability. Success depends on backup integrity, app version, and encryption.
❌ Creating a full device backup from the phone app. This requires a computer.
