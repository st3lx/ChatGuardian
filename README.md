# ChatGuardian
Accidentally deleted your chat history? Went to check a file or picture but found it's outdated? Try out ChatGuardian: <br>
A desktop app to proactively archive and retroactively recover WeChat, Whatsapp, Telegram, Discord, [basically any app you want to add] messages &amp; media from local device backups. <br>

**It WILL Work / Is Designed For** <br>
✅ Recovering data from existing backups (iTunes, adb, Google Drive backups of the device).	<br>
✅ Recovering "deleted" data that still exists in a backup file (e.g., you deleted chats after your last backup).	<br>
✅ Recovering "out-of-date" data like old images whose links have expired, from a backup.	<br>
✅ Proactive archiving via scheduled, automated local backups and parsing.	<br>
✅ Organizing and preserving data you already have access to (via backup).	<br>
✅ Acting as a powerful viewer for your own archived chat history across devices.	<br><br>
**It WILL NOT Work / Is Not Designed For** <br>
❌ Recovering data from a factory-reset or broken phone with no pre-existing backup. <br>
❌ Recovering data that has been physically overwritten on the device's storage (true forensic data recovery). <br>
❌ Bypassing app encryption or hacking into accounts without the backup file or password. <br>
❌ Real-time message interception or violating the terms of service of the chat apps. <br>
❌ 100% reliability. Success depends on backup integrity, app version, and encryption. <br>
❌ Creating a full device backup from the phone app. This requires a computer. <br>
